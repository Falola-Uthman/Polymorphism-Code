# Polymorphism-Code

## Objective

The Polymorphism-Code project was a deep dive into the dynamic landscape of code versatility and security. The main goal was to create and manipulate a password strength checker script using polymorphism techniques. This process involved encryption, execution, and re-encryption, providing me with a profound understanding of how polymorphic code can be used for enhancing security and protecting intellectual property.

## Skills Learned

- Scripting Proficiency: Developed a password strength checker script using complex regular expressions to ensure robust password policies.
- Advanced Encryption: Applied the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to encrypt and secure the password checker script, reinforcing my knowledge in cryptographic security measures.
- Dynamic Code Execution: Mastered the execution of encrypted scripts in Python, enhancing my ability to work with secure code in volatile environments.
- Polymorphic Techniques: Learned to employ polymorphism to alter the code after each execution cycle, which is vital for malware defense and intellectual property protection.
- Code Protection Strategies: Gained insight into the techniques for software protection against unauthorized use and reverse engineering.

## Tools Used

- Python: Primary programming language used for developing the password checker and encryption scripts.
- AES Encryption: Utilized for the secure encryption of the password strength checker script.
- Regular Expressions: Implemented for setting and evaluating password strength criteria.


## Steps

- Developed a password strength checker script that validates password robustness against predefined criteria.
- Encrypted the password checker script using AES encryption, securing the logic with a randomly generated key and IV.
- Executed the encrypted script, ensuring its functionality remained intact while maintaining the confidentiality of its contents.
- Implemented a re-encryption process that updates the encryption key and IV after each execution, showcasing polymorphic capabilities.
- Demonstrated the execution of the script in a controlled environment, confirming the scriptâ€™s integrity and the security of the encryption process.
